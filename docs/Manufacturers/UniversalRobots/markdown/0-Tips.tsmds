### 0. Tips

1. We do not currently have a means to reference _TCPs_ and _Payloads_ from your current Installation so make sure these are accurately defined in your simulation.
2. You can switch between Process Move (_movep_) and normal (_movel_) for linear motion in the [Controller]({{gl.controller}}) configurator.
3. [Signals]({{gl.signal}}) are identified by their indices so either name your [signals]({{gl.signal}}) with an index, e.g. _2_, or use the [export overrides]({{ghl.reuse-controller-data}}) to ensure the correct index is exported.
