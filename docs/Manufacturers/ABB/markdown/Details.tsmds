#### Details:

You'll find a number of different ABB controllers in our catalogs but between the multiple _OmniCore_ and _IRC5_ versions the only major difference is the geometry. The [Controller]({{gl.controller}}) type (_OmniCore_ or _IRC5_) will also define which software versions are available and therefore which [Subsystems]({{gl.subsystems}}) can be chosen.
